This project creates a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, the player populates his colony with the bravest ants he can muster. His ants must protect his queen from the evil bees that invade his territory. 
Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Chapter 2.5 of Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.
